## Known issues

- The fetching of episodes and seasons tend's to fail to specific shows. The same doesn't happen when making the same calls vie [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). At the moment still I haven't been able to find the reason behind this issue and fix it.

- Sometimes fetching of the next page, on the paged tab, also misbehaves sometimes, probably by the same reason behind the previous issue.
